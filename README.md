# NI Linux Real-Time Linux Kernel Mirror

This repository contains the Linux kernel branches used for the Linux
kernel as it is built and provided in the LabVIEW Real-Time and
CompactRIO Support installation media. Each release's kernel source
exists in its own branch (with accompanying release tag).

The [NILRT](https://github.com/ni/nilrt) repository has complete
instructions and details on how to build and install a suitable kernel
for your particular release.
