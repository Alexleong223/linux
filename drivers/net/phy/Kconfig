	---help---
	  Currently supports the qs6612

config LXT_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for the Intel LXT PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the lxt970, lxt971

config CICADA_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for the Cicada PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the cis8204

config VITESSE_PHY
        tristate "Drivers for the Vitesse PHYs"
        ---help---
          Currently supports the vsc8244

config SMSC_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for SMSC PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the LAN83C185, LAN8187 and LAN8700 PHYs

config BROADCOM_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Broadcom PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the BCM5411, BCM5421, BCM5461, BCM5464, BCM5481
	  and BCM5482 PHYs.

config BCM63XX_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Broadcom 63xx SOCs internal PHY"
	depends on BCM63XX
	---help---
	  Currently supports the 6348 and 6358 PHYs.

config ICPLUS_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for ICPlus PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the IP175C and IP1001 PHYs.

config REALTEK_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Realtek PHYs"
	---help---
	  Supports the Realtek 821x PHY.

config NATIONAL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for National Semiconductor PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the DP83865 PHY.

config STE10XP
	tristate "Driver for STMicroelectronics STe10Xp PHYs"
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the STe100p and STe101p PHYs.

config LSI_ET1011C_PHY
	tristate "Driver for LSI ET1011C PHY"
	---help---
	  Supports the LSI ET1011C PHY.

config MICREL_PHY
	tristate "Driver for Micrel PHYs"
	---help---
	  Supports the KSZ9021, VSC8201, KS8001 PHYs.

config PHY_NO_THREADED_IRQS
	tristate "Never use threaded interrupts for PHY devices"
	---help---
	  Interrupt handlers sometimes will use threads by default, for example
	  when the RT patch is applied. Enabling this option will cause PHY
	  interrupts to never use threaded IRQs. This may be necessary if your PHY
	  interrupt line is shared by other devices on a GPIO input. Note that PHY
	  interrupts are already deferred to a work queue, so enabling this option
	  shouldn't have any noticeable side effects.

config PHY_NO_UNNECESSARY_POLLING
	tristate "Don't poll unnecessarily when PHY interrupts are in use"
	---help---
	  The PHY state machine is scheduled to run and process the current state
	  once a second, even if the PHY is configured to use interrupts. Enabling
	  this option will cause this PHY polling to be disabled when a PHY is in
	  the PHY_RUNNING or PHY_NOLINK state. When the link state changes, a PHY
	  interrupt should occur, causing the PHY state machine to run immediately.

config FIXED_PHY
	bool "Driver for MDIO Bus/PHY emulation with fixed speed/link PHYs"
	depends on PHYLIB=y
	---help---
	  Adds the platform "fixed" MDIO Bus to cover the boards that use
	  PHYs that are not connected to the real MDIO bus.

	  Currently tested with mpc866ads and mpc8349e-mitx.

config LED_TRIGGER_PHY
	bool "Support LED triggers for tracking link state"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	---help---
	  Adds support for a set of LED trigger events per-PHY.  Link
	  state change will trigger the events, for consumption by an
	  LED class driver.  There are triggers for each link speed, and are of the
	  form:
	       <mii bus id>:<phy>:<speed>
	
	  Where speed is one of: 10Mb, 100Mb, Gb, 2.5Gb, or 10GbE.

config MDIO_BITBANG
	tristate "Support for bitbanged MDIO buses"
	help
	  This module implements the MDIO bus protocol in software,
	  for use by low level drivers that export the ability to
	  drive the relevant pins.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config MDIO_GPIO
	tristate "Support for GPIO lib-based bitbanged MDIO buses"
	depends on MDIO_BITBANG && GENERIC_GPIO
	---help---
	  Supports GPIO lib-based MDIO busses.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mdio-gpio.

config MDIO_OCTEON
	tristate "Support for MDIO buses on Octeon SOCs"
	depends on  CPU_CAVIUM_OCTEON
	default y
	help

	  This module provides a driver for the Octeon MDIO busses.
	  It is required by the Octeon Ethernet device drivers.

	  If in doubt, say Y.
